Connect to the Datafeedr API.

== Description ==

**NOTE:** The *Datafeedr API* plugin requires that you have Datafeedr API keys. API keys can be accessed here: [https://v4.datafeedr.com/pricing](https://v4.datafeedr.com/pricing?p=1&utm_campaign=dfrapiplugin&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wporg)

The Datafeedr API provides access to our database of affiliate products. We have aggregated over 250,000,000 products from over 10,000 merchants and 32 affiliate networks. We have indexed and normalized the product data making it easy for you to search for and find products you want to promote on your website.

The *Datafeedr API* plugin currently integrates with the following plugins:

* [Datafeedr WooCommerce Importer](http://wordpress.org/plugins/datafeedr-woocommerce-importer/)
* [Datafeedr Product Sets](http://wordpress.org/plugins/datafeedr-product-sets/)

The *Datafeedr API* plugin provides the interface to connect to the Datafeedr API and perform the following tasks:

* Configure your API connection settings.
* Select affiliate networks you are a member of.
* Select merchants who have approved you.
* Add your affiliate network affiliate IDs.
* Import/export your selection of affiliate networks and/or merchants.
* View your API account usage.

The *Datafeedr API* plugin was built to be extended. The *Datafeedr API* plugin contains its own functions that third party developers can use to connect to the Datafeedr API, make search requests or display an 'advanced search' form. We encourage other developers to build on top of the *Datafeedr API* plugin.

Additionally, we have written plugins that integrate the *Datafeedr API* plugin with WooCommerce. More extensions are on the way...
